# FEW 2.3 - Lesson 11

## React Hooks

React Hooks are a new feature that is finding a lot of use. Hooks were introduced around React 16. The React Team says Hooks are in addition to class based components, and you are not required to use them. In other words hooks will not break prior code. 

Why use hooks? Hooks provide a system to use components written as functions everywhere. Previously only Class based components could use state and lifecycle methods. Now you have access to state and lifecycle methods with Hooks in components written as functions. 

## Why you should know this

- Hooks allow you to unify your component code to a single style. Rather than writting some components as a functions and others as classes you can write everything as functions. 
- Hooks make much code easier, or at least shorter than using class based components.
