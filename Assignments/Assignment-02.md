# Class - FEW 2.3 - Assignment 2

## Description 

With this project you'll connect to the OpenWeatherMap API and display the weather data. You'll use the controlled component pattern to handle user input. 

- Controlled Controlled Component Pattern. This pattern is used with form elements. 
- Conditional Rendering pattern. This is a collection of coding patterns that render components or not render them based on props or state. 

### Why this assignment?

The controlled pattern component is important since you'll use it every time you use form elements like input fields, check boxes, and radios buttons. All of these are essential to web applications. 

Conditionally rendering components is an important front end development it opens up lots of possiblities to the user interfaces you create with React.
