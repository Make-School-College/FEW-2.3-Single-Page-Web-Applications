Application state is at the core of every app. Using a modern update pattern and understanding that pattern will make you a stronger developer. 

## Project requirements

Your goal is to choose one of the tutorials below and complete it. The tutorials are ranked in level of difficulty. 

1. [React+Redux Password List](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-passwords-app) - This is an alternate take on the Todo List. The app keeps track of a list of user names and passwords, and generates random passwords. It uses React for views, Redux to manage application state, and resists data in local storage. 
2. [React+Redux Timers App](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-timers-app) - An advanced alternative to the Todo list.
