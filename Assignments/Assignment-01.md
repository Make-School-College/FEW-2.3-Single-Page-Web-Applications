### Why this assignment?

React has some foundational concepts and work flows that need to be mastered. This assignment give you the opportunity to dig into these topics.  

## Project requirements

Your goal is to follow and complete this tutorial: 

- [React Fundamentals Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/react-fundamentals-vm0)

You will create a single web page using React. You will break all of the elements on the page down into Components that you write. Then you will build your page from the Components you created!

The subject for this assignment is your portfolio. The project should contain a heading with your name. The body of the pages should display a list of projects you have created with an image and short description. 

Post your completed tutorial to GitHub and add a link to the Progress Tracker. 

### Challenges 

After you complete the tutorial try these challenges. Try to complete as many of these challenges as you can.  

- Make a component that displays a copyright message with the date in the footer. 
    - You should be able to use the component like this: `<Copyright owner="Mitchell Hudson" />`
    - It should display something like: "Mitchell Hudson Â© 2019"
    - The Year should be generated automatically. Use the Date Object to get the current year. 
- Add a Like Count to each project. This is fixed number that you can invent for each project.
    - Pass the number of likes to each component as a prop.
    - Display the number of likes in the Project component. 
    - Apply a style to likes.
- Add more styles to the project. This is an open ended challenge. 
    - Style the header
    - Style the footer
    - Style the project
- Add a new Info section that displays information about you. 
    - This should be a new component.
    - It should appear below your project and above the footer.

If you're looking for even tougher challenges try this stretch challenge.
