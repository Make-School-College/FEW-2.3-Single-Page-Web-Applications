# Single Page Applications

Single Page Applications (SPAs) FTW!

## Course Description

This course covers the process and tools used to build single page applications (SPA) using the most up-to-date tools and techniques. Students will learn to manage state and render on state changes using reactive programming techniques. Modern JavaScript libraries including React will be used.

### Why you should know this

Single pages Applications are the norm for web applications today. They provide a higher level of functionality not available to simple web pages.

Single page applications are the basis for most of your favorite web destinations and the future of mobile computing!

If you want to build next-generation mobile experiences that reach the widest possible audience with greatest functionality single page applications are a good bet.

### Projects

Begin each project by creating a GitHub Repo for that project. Start with a Readme that has a short description of what you doing. 

Each time you sit down to work on the project you should commit at least once. Commit more often if you like. 

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large number of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

### Final Exam

-  **Passing the exam is a requirement for passing the class.**
- You will have 2 hours to complete this exam - it will be in class using paper and pencil, or a format of the instructor's choosing
- There are no retakes of the exam.
- If you have a disability that needs an accommodation such as extended time or a different format, please take advantage of our [accommodations program](make.sc/disability-policy).

### Other Class assignments

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being on site from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching, and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors, and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
