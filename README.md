## Course Description

This course covers the process and tools used to build single page applications (SPA) using the most up-to-date tools and techniques. Students will learn to manage state and render on state changes using reactive programming techniques. Modern JavaScript libraries including React will be used.

### Why you should know this

Single pages Applications are the norm for web applications today. They provide a higher level of functionality not available to simple web pages.

Single page applications are the basis for most of your favorite web destinations and the future of mobile computing!

If you want to build next-generation mobile experiences that reach the widest possible audience with greatest functionality single page applications are a good bet.
